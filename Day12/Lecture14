###  data types ###
> Float
- 'float' is one of the predefined class and treated as fundamental data types.
- The purpose of float adata type is that "To store real constant values OR floating point values (numbers with decimal values).
- the float datatypes is also used for storing floating point value in the scienticfic notation. 
 The notation scienticfic nataton is "Mantisa e Exponent OR Mantisa e -Exponent ".
- The equivalent float point value for scientic natation "Mantisa e Exponent" is mantisa * 10 to the power of exponent .
- floating data types never allow binary, octal, hexa decimal values. but only decimal number system values.

*   e -> 10 exponent 

> bool 

- 'Bool is one pre-defined class treated as fundamental data type.
- The purpose of bool data type is that store True and False values(Logical Values).
- Here True and False is a Keywords and considered as values for bool data type.
- Internally, True value is treated as 1 and False is treated as 0

- 
> complex 
- 'complex' is one pre-defined class treated as fundamental data type.
- The purpose of complex data type is that "To store complex values and perform operations complex values.
- The general natation of complex number is given below.
    a+bj OR a-bj
    - here 'a' is called real part
    - here 'b' is called imaginary part
    - here Letter 'j' represent sqrt(-1) OR sqr(j) = -1
- Internally, real part and imaginary part are considered as float values.
- to get REal part and Imaginary parts from complex object, we use two pre-defined attributes. they are

1. real
2. imag

-- syntax : complexobj.real gives real part of complex object 
--        : complexobj.imag   --> gives imaginary part of complex object
