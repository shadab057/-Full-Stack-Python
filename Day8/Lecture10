=> Project -- Runs<-- End-user OR  Application User Enters Invalid Input---- By default ---> Technical Error Messages 


> We have 3 types of Error 

1. Complie time Errors <-- occurs due to syntaxes of the language are not followed during compilation phase (.py---> .pyc)>
-    solved by Programmers in Development time 


2. Logical Errors <-- occurs sdue to invalid OR wrong Representation of Logic >
- During Execution Phase
- Gives wrong result

3. Runtime Errors  <-- occurs due to invalid input / Wrong inputs entered by END-USER / App User during Execution Phase (Implementation Phase)>

  >  Example :  
  
  > ATM Application ---> ATM customer may keep the card reserve order

  * ATM customer may keep the card reserve order .(Understandable by Programmers but not by end-users)
  * ATM customer may enter PIN wrong 
  * ATM customer may enter wrong amount 

# Robust (Strong) #

-> Python programming provdes a programming feature called "Exception Handling".
-> Due to exception handling facility, python based application becomes robust(strong).

----------------------------------------------
> Exception 

* Every runtime error of the program is called exception.
(Invalid input ---> Runtime Error-->Exception)
* By default All Exception (Runtime Errors) gives Technical Error message.which are understandle by programmers but not by end-users and this is not a recommended process in software industry.

* software industry recommends convert tecnical error message into user friendly error message by using exception handling.


------  
The process of converating technical error message into user-friendly error message is called exception handling.

# Extensible  and Embedded #

# Extensible :

python programming provides its modules to other languages - c, c++, html, javascript

# Embedded 

* python language uses other language code segments / snipets
