----------------------------

- The Processed information of Data is Called Data.
         (OR)
- OR Studying the insights of information is called Data
- The Purpose of Data is that "To Effective Decisions in Oraganizations.

> Python Literals, are values/data that is given in a variable(constants)

- Ex: 10,5.6,"Hi", True etc


$ Types of Literals (OR) Values (OR) Data

- Interal Litrals
- Float Litrals
- Boolean Litrals
- String Litrals
- Collection Litrals
  * List listerals [], 
  * Tuple literals(), Can't Modify 
  * Dict literals{},
  * Set literals{"rno": 10101},


$ Importance of Identifier OR Variables

- In programming language, literals must be stored in main memory by allocating sufficient amount of memory space with the help of data types.
- We know that all types LITERALS are stored in main memory by having memory space.
- To process values which are present in memory space, programmers must give DISTINCT NAMES to created memory  
- The IDENTIFIER Values are Changing / Varying during Program Execution and hence IDENTIFIERS are called VARIABLES
- Hence All types of LITREALS are stored in the form VARIABLES and all variables are called OBJECTS.

------------------------
Defination of Varaible:

A Varaible is an identifier, whose value can be changed OR varying during the program execution.

> Rules of using Variable OR Identifier in Python 

-  To use Variable in Python Program, we must follow the Rules.
- The Rules for using Varaibles in Python Program are 

1. The Variable name is a combination of Alphabets, digits and speacial symbol underscore(_).
2. The First letter of variable name must starts either with Alphphet OR Special Symbol Under Score(_) only.
3. No reserved words: don’t use if, for, class, True, None, etc.
4. Case-sensitive: age and Age are different names.
Example:  
✅ score1, _temp, user_name
❌ 1stPlace, user-name, my@var
