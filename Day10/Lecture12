### Rule - 5 ###

> All the Variable names in python are case sensitive 

> Data types in python 
- The puropose of Data Types in python is that "allocate sufficient amount of memory space in main memory for storing the Data.

- IN python programming we have 14 Data types and they are classified into 6 categories. They are 

1 . Fundamental category Data Types
------------------------------------
- int 
- float
- bool
- complex

2 . Sequence category data types 
-------------------------------------
- str
- bytes
- bytearray
- range

3 . List category data types
----------------------------------
- list
- tuple

4 . Set category data types(collections data types)
---------------------------------------------
- set
- frozenset

5 . dict category data type(collection data types)
----------------------------------
- dict

6 . None type category data type
-------------------------
- None Type

>  Fundamental category Data Types
- The purpose of fundamental category Data types is that "To Store Single Value".
- In Python Programmng, we have 4 Data types in Fundamental Category. They are 

- int
- float
- bool
- complex

$$$$>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>$$$$

>>> int   
- 'int' is one of the pre-defined class and treated as fundamental Data Type.
- The purpose of int Data type is that "To store whole numbers OR Integral Values (values without decimal places)
- By using in data type, we can also store different type of number systems.
- In python Progaramming, we 4 types of number system. they are 

1. Decimal Number System
2. Binary Number System 
3. Octal Number System 
4. Hexa Decimal Numbeer System

-----------------------

> Decimal Number System
- This Number System followed by all human beings for thier day-to-day operations 
- This Number System contains the following 
    = Digits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
- All Base 10 Values are called Decimal Number System values.

> Binary Number System
- The Number Sytem understandable by OS and Processor .
-  Digits: 0 1 ---- Total Digits: 2
   Base: 2
- All Base 2 Values are called Binary DAta, The Binary Data must be preceded with a letter 0b or 0B.
  Syntax: varname=0b Binary Value
       (OR)
       varname=0B Binary Value
- In python Programming, even through we store Binary Data, Internally Python Execution Environment automatically OR implicity converts into decimal number system.
Note: To Convert Decimal Number System value into Binary NUmber System Value, we use a Pre-defined dunction called bin()

varname=bin(Decimal / Octal / Hexa Decimal)

> Octal Number System 
- The Number Sytem understandable by Micro Processor Kits Like in 8086 OR Assembly language programming 

- This Number System contains the following 
-  Digits: 0 1 3 4 5 6 7 ---- Total Digits: 8
   Base: 8
- All Base 8 Values are called Ocatal Number System VAlues.
    Syntax: varname=0b Octal Value
    varname=0B Octal Value

> Hexa Decimal System
