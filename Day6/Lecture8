# Dynamically Typed

> In IT, we have Two Types of programming language They are 

1. Static Typed Programming Language.
2. Dynamically typed programming language.

Data Types  <-------  To allocate Memory space for Storing Inputs
> store 100 in memory  ------- 1. allocate memory space ---- Data Type
> Give the name to memory space --- say -a

int a ----> variable Declaration--Mandatory--Static typed programming language


> Task: Compute Sum of Two Numbers

Take 10 20 and store in a and b
compute a+b and store in c

let a=10 and b=20
let compute c=a+b
